  return `You are creating a persuasive AI readiness report. Your job is to transform solution data into compelling executive communication that feels personalized to ${companyName} in the ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.industry} industry.

IMPORTANT: You MUST include ALL solutions from clientSolution.implementedSolutions in the report. If there are 3 solutions, the report MUST have 3 solution entries. Each solution addresses specific problems - include them all.

CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NARRATIVE VOICE:
- Company: ${companyName}
- They are a ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.companySize} ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.industry} company
- Their budget is ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.monthlyBudget}
- Their timeline urgency is ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.urgency}
- They currently use: ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.currentSystems}
- Their main objectives: ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.businessObjectives}

RAW DATA TO TRANSFORM:
Problems Identified: ${JSON.stringify(problemAnalysis.topOpportunities, null, 2)}
Our Solutions: ${JSON.stringify(clientSolution, null, 2)}

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Write for busy decision-makers who scan first, read second
- Lead with clear outcomes, not technical features
- Use round, memorable numbers ($15,000 not $14,847)
- Write conversationally: "You'll save 20 hours per week" not "20-hour weekly time reduction achieved"
- Explain complex ideas simply: "This pays for itself in 4 months" not "ROI trajectory indicates 4-month amortization"
- Use active voice and confident language
- Avoid jargon: write "customer service software" not "CX automation suite"

NUMBER PRESENTATION RULES:
- Round all figures to executive-friendly numbers
- Present time in simple terms: "15 hours per week" not "≈86 hours/month" 
- Show ROI simply: "300% return in year one" not "≈358% return on investment (net gains over first-year investment)"
- Avoid formula language: use "saves $5,000 monthly on labor costs" not "$5,000/month labor cost reduction"
- Present ranges naturally: "2-3 months payback" not "payback period: 2.3 months"
- Use specific context: "saves $8,000 monthly on staff time" not "delivers $8,000 monthly savings"

WRITING QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Each problem description should be a clear, urgent business story
- Solutions should read like confident consulting recommendations  
- ROI explanations should be simple and credible
- Case studies should feel relevant and achievable
- Next steps should feel actionable and specific
- Vary your language - don't repeat the same phrases

BUSINESS WRITING APPROACH:
1. PROBLEMS: Write as urgent business stories using their industry language
2. SOLUTIONS: Write as confident recommendations focusing on outcomes
3. NUMBERS: Present simply and credibly, avoiding complex ranges
4. PROOF: Make case studies relatable to their business type
5. NEXT STEPS: Write as clear, actionable business advice

WRITING PATTERNS (Use variety, don't repeat):
Problems:
- "At [Company], [specific situation] is costing [clear impact]"
- "[Company] is losing [amount] because [specific issue]"
- "Your team spends [time] on [task] when they could be [better activity]"

Solutions:
- "We'll implement [simple description] that [clear outcome]"
- "Our system automatically [action] so your team can [focus on what]"
- "This solution [eliminates/reduces/improves] [specific problem]"

ROI Presentation:
- "This investment pays for itself in [X] months, then delivers [Y] annually"
- "You'll see [specific improvement] within [timeframe]"
- "Expect [percentage] improvement in [metric] starting [when]"

Proof Examples (Vary these):
- "A similar [industry/size] company saw [specific result]"
- "Another [business type] we worked with achieved [outcome]"  
- "One of our [industry] clients improved [metric] by [amount]"
- "A comparable business increased [result] after implementation"

YOUR TRANSFORMATION TASK:
1. Synthesize numerical data into executive-friendly insights
2. Rewrite everything in language appropriate for their industry
3. Make problems feel urgent using their actual pain points
4. Position DeployAI's solutions as transformative (but stay truthful to data)
5. Transform proven results into relatable business examples
6. Create a narrative arc: current pain → what we'll implement → clear next step
7. MANDATORY: Include ALL solutions from clientSolution.implementedSolutions
8. MANDATORY: Include projectedOutcomes for ALL solutions
9. Present everything as DeployAI's expertise and implementation, not third-party tools

- Ensure numbers tell a clear, credible story
- Verify the language matches their industry and business size
- Check that urgency feels appropriate, not manipulative
- Confirm all solutions from clientSolution.implementedSolutions are included
- Ensure variety in language patterns and proof examples

Remember: You're translating technical data into THEIR business language while keeping all numbers accurate and credible.
