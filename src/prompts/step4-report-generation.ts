CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use generic AI solution categories, NEVER mention specific tool brands (Zapier, Intercom, HubSpot, etc.)
- Transform tool names into descriptive categories (e.g., "Intercom" â†’ "Intelligent Customer Response System")
- Base all problem descriptions on actual quiz responses and problem analysis
- Include ALL case studies from curatedTools (1-3 per solution) - make anonymous but keep specifics
- Pull exact metrics and improvements from curatedTools success metrics
- whereToStart MUST reference the Priority 1 tool from curatedTools
- Calculate costs and gains from the problem analysis and tool research data
- Executive summary data comes directly from curatedTools.executiveSummary
- Projected outcomes should create a clear before/after table view

TRANSFORMATION RULES:
- Keep case study details but anonymize company names ("Mid-size SaaS with 200 employees" not "Acme Corp")
- Use the verboseName from curatedTools for solutionName
- Pull primaryBenefits directly from curatedTools
- Use full description paragraphs from curatedTools
- Map each solution to specific problems using directImpact data

EXAMPLES OF GOOD SOLUTION NAMES:
- "Intelligent Customer Response and Engagement Platform"
- "Advanced Workflow Automation and Integration System"
- "AI-Powered Sales Intelligence and Forecasting Platform"
- "Document Intelligence and Processing Engine"
- "Predictive Maintenance and Quality Control System"

CRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not wrap in markdown code blocks. Do not add explanations. Start with { and end with }`;
