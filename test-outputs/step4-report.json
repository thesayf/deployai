    {
      "problem": "At Akshar Business Consulting Ltd, manual data entry between systems is eating up finance and admin time every week.",

      "potentialGain": "Cut cross-system entry to about 1 hour per week, freeing roughly 7 hours weekly and saving about $1,000 per month while improving data accuracy for reporting."

      "problem": "Invoice creation and payment processing is leaving cash and reporting unreliable and behind competitors.",
      "currentCost": "Creating invoices and applying payments costs about 8 hours per week and roughly $1,000–$1,600 per month in staff time, plus it drives a separate $1,750/month cash-reporting problem from unallocated payments.",
      "potentialGain": "Reduce invoicing and payment work to about 1 hour per week, recover faster cash visibility, and remove the $1,750/month reporting pain—roughly $1,200 per month saved in staff time plus better cash accuracy."

      "problem": "Reporting and bookkeeping are a missed opportunity: leadership spends time wrangling data instead of deciding and scaling operations.",

      "potentialGain": "Automate reconciled dashboards so reporting drops to about 1 hour per week, saving roughly $800 per month and giving leadership back the time to focus on growth and capacity planning."
