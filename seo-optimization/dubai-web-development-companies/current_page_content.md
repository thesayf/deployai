## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I look for in a Dubai web development portfolio?

Essential elements: Live website URLs you can actually visit and test. Industry-relevant experience in your sector (real estate, hospitality, e-commerce). Technical complexity beyond template modifications. Case studies with specific challenges and results achieved. Mobile responsiveness across all portfolio sites. Red flags: Broken portfolio links, all sites look identical, no recent work (older than 2-3 years), unverifiable client claims.

### Do Dubai web companies offer ongoing support and maintenance?

Most established companies offer comprehensive maintenance packages. Standard services include security updates, content management (2-10 hours/month), backup management, performance monitoring, and bug fixes. Pricing ranges AED 500-15,000/month depending on complexity. Digital Gravity includes security and speed optimization starting at AED 4K/month. Ask about response times, emergency support availability, and whether they maintain sites they didn't originally build.

### Can Dubai web development companies handle e-commerce projects?

Yes, most Dubai companies handle e-commerce, but approaches vary. Traditional agencies use WooCommerce, Magento, or Shopify with extensive customization. Data-driven companies focus on conversion optimization and performance. AI-first companies like DeployAI build modern headless e-commerce with advanced features like AI product recommendations. Consider your needs: simple store setup vs. complex multi-vendor marketplaces with custom payment integrations.

### How do Dubai web development costs compare internationally?

Dubai offers competitive middle-ground pricing. Basic business sites: Dubai $4K-8K vs. USA/UK $8K-15K vs. India $1.5K-3K. E-commerce: Dubai $19K-38K vs. USA/UK $25K-50K vs. India $5K-12K. Dubai advantages: lower costs than Western markets, higher quality than pure outsourcing, English proficiency, time zone overlap with Europe/Asia, and local market understanding for MENA businesses.

### Should I choose a local Dubai company or international agency?

Local Dubai companies offer face-to-face meetings, cultural understanding, knowledge of UAE regulations, and regional market expertise. International agencies may provide broader experience but lack local nuance. For UAE-focused businesses, local companies understand Arabic language requirements, local payment gateways (Telr, PayTabs), and cultural sensitivities. However, ensure the local company uses modern technologies and global best practices.

### What are the latest web development trends in UAE businesses?

Major trends include AI integration (40% of new projects), Progressive Web Apps for mobile-first experiences, Arabic language AI and voice search optimization, UAE Pass integration for government services, and blockchain for real estate/supply chain. E-commerce trends: social commerce (Instagram/TikTok shopping), Buy Now Pay Later (Tabby/Postpay), and multi-language support. DeployAI specializes in implementing these cutting-edge features using modern frameworks.

### Is a 4-8 week timeline really possible for quality work?

Yes, but it depends on the approach. Traditional custom development (12-20 weeks) involves extensive PHP/WordPress customization and manual processes. Modern frameworks like React and Next.js, combined with AI tooling and component libraries, can dramatically reduce development time while maintaining quality. However, this works best for MVPs and projects that fit modern patterns - complex custom functionality may still require traditional timelines.

### What's the difference between WordPress and modern framework development?

WordPress: Familiar CMS, extensive plugins, easy content management, but slower performance and security vulnerabilities. Modern frameworks (React/Next.js): 3-5x faster loading, better SEO through server-side rendering, enhanced security, mobile-first design, but require more technical expertise. AI-first companies like DeployAI use modern frameworks for better performance and future-proofing, while traditional agencies stick with WordPress for client familiarity.

### How do I evaluate if an agency's claims are legitimate?

Look for specific metrics and case studies. Digital Gravity shows '75-120% performance improvements' with actual client data. Traditional agencies highlight '1000+ successful projects' with portfolio evidence. Ask for live website examples, client references you can contact, and specific explanations of their role in showcased projects. Be wary of vague claims like 'best in Dubai' without supporting data or broken links in their own portfolio.
