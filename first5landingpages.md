## 1. Landing Page Template: "Custom Software Development Dubai"

### Hero Section (Modify existing `src/components/hero/Copy.tsx`)

```tsx
// Replace in Copy.tsx for custom software development page
export const Copy = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="mb-1.5 rounded-full bg-zinc-600">
        <Link
          href="https://calendly.com/hello-deployai/30min"
          target="_blank"
          rel="nofollow"
          className="flex origin-top-left items-center rounded-full border border-zinc-900 bg-white p-0.5 text-sm transition-transform hover:-rotate-2"
        >
          <span className="rounded-full bg-indigo-600 px-2 py-0.5 font-medium text-white">
            DUBAI
          </span>
          <span className="ml-1.5 mr-1 inline-block">

        </Link>
      </div>
      <h1 className="max-w-4xl text-center text-4xl font-black leading-[1.15] md:text-7xl md:leading-[1.15]">

      </p>
      {/* CTA and LogoTicker remain the same */}
    </>
  );
};
```

### Service Features Section (New Component based on FeatureToggles structure)

Create `src/components/service-features/ServiceFeatures.tsx`:

```tsx
// Use same structure as FeatureToggles but with service-specific content
const serviceFeatures = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Enterprise Solutions",
    cardTitle: "Built for Scale",
    cardSubtitle: "Enterprise-grade architecture from day one",
    features: [
      "Custom business process automation",
      "Legacy system modernization",
      "API development & integration",
      "Multi-user role management"
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Dubai Compliance",
    cardTitle: "UAE Ready",
    cardSubtitle: "Compliant with local regulations",
    features: [
      "Arabic language support",
      "UAE data protection compliance",
      "Multi-currency support (AED/USD/EUR)",
      "Local payment gateway integration"
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Rapid Deployment",
    cardTitle: "30-Day Delivery",
    cardSubtitle: "From concept to production",
    features: [
      "Agile development methodology",
      "Weekly progress updates",
      "Source code ownership",
      "3 months free updates"
    ]
  }
];

// Use existing FeatureToggles component structure with new data
```

### Problem/Agitation Section (Modify existing `ProblemAgitation.tsx`)

```tsx
// Update the existing ProblemAgitation component for software development specific pain points
const problems = [
  "Manual processes costing 20+ hours per week",
  "Off-the-shelf software that doesn't fit your workflow",
  "Paying $5K+ monthly for tools you don't own",
  "Integration nightmares between different systems"
];

const solutions = [
  "Custom automation that saves 80% of manual work",
  "Software built exactly for your business processes",
  "One-time investment, lifetime ownership",
  "Seamless integration with existing systems"
];
```

### Case Studies Section (Use existing structure with relevant case studies)

Filter existing `CASE_STUDIES_DATA` in `CaseStudies.tsx` to show relevant examples:

```tsx
// Show only relevant case studies for software development
const relevantCaseStudies = CASE_STUDIES_DATA.filter(study =>
  study.service.includes('Custom') ||
  study.service.includes('Dashboard') ||
  study.service.includes('System')
);
```

### Pricing Section (Modify existing `PricingSection.tsx`)

```tsx
// Update pricing plans to focus on software development services
const softwarePricingPlans = [
  {
    name: "Business Tool",
    subtitle: "Perfect for SMEs",
    monthlyPrice: "$8,000",
    annualPrice: "$6,500",
    description: "Custom internal tool to streamline operations",

  {

    subtitle: "For growing companies",
    monthlyPrice: "$15,000",
    annualPrice: "$12,500",
    description: "Comprehensive business management platform",

```

## 3. Reusable Component Patterns

### Trust Signals Component (Use existing styling patterns)

```tsx
// Create src/components/trust-signals/TrustSignals.tsx
export const TrustSignals = ({ variant = "default" }) => {
  return (
    <div className="mx-auto mt-8 grid max-w-4xl grid-cols-2 gap-4 md:grid-cols-4">
      <div className="flex h-20 items-center justify-center gap-3 rounded-xl border-2 border-zinc-900 bg-white p-4 shadow-[2px_2px_0px_#18181b]">
        <div className="flex items-center text-2xl">üèÜ</div>
        <div className="flex flex-1 flex-col justify-center">
          <div className="text-sm font-bold leading-tight">ISO 27001</div>
          <div className="text-xs text-zinc-600 leading-tight">Security certified</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      {/* Add more trust signals following same pattern */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### ROI Calculator Component

```tsx
// Create src/components/roi-calculator/ROICalculator.tsx
// Use same border/shadow styling as pricing cards
export const ROICalculator = () => {
  return (
    <div className="rounded-2xl border-4 border-zinc-900 bg-white p-8 shadow-[8px_8px_0px_0px_rgb(39,39,42)]">
      <h3 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold text-center">
        Calculate Your Potential Savings
      </h3>
      {/* Interactive calculator using existing button/input styles */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

---

## 4. Development Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create New Page Files

```bash
# Create new pages following existing structure
src/pages/custom-software-development-dubai.tsx
src/pages/inventory-management-system-dubai.tsx
src/pages/web-application-development-dubai.tsx
src/pages/ai-development-services.tsx
```

### Step 2: Component Modifications

```tsx
// Each new page follows this structure:
import { Hero } from "@/components/hero/Hero";
import { AnimatedNavBar } from "@/components/navigation/AnimatedNavBar";
import { FAQ } from "@/components/faq/FAQ";
// ... other imports

export default function CustomSoftwarePage() {
  return (
    <main className={`${font.className}`} style={{ scrollSnapType: "y proximity" }}>
      <AnimatedNavBar />
      <Hero variant="software" /> // Pass variant prop
      <ProblemAgitation variant="software" />
      <ServiceFeatures data={softwareFeatures} />
      <CaseStudies filter="software" />
      <StaggerTestimonials />
      <PricingSection variant="software" />
      <div className="py-16">
        <FAQ variant="customSoftware" />
      </div>
      <CalendlyInline />
      <Footer />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Use Existing Testimonials & Case Studies

**Existing testimonials to use (from StaggerTestimonials.tsx):**

- Karine (Education automation)
- Judah (Booking automation)
- Plus any others already in TESTIMONIAL_DATA

**Existing case studies to reference (from CaseStudies.tsx):**

- Filter by relevant service types
- Use actual company names and results
- No fake content - only real examples

### Step 4: Styling Consistency

**Use established patterns:**

- `border-2 border-zinc-900` for standard borders
- `shadow-[4px_4px_0px_#18181b]` for button shadows
- `rounded-xl` or `rounded-2xl` for cards
- `bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-red-500` for primary CTAs
- `text-zinc-600` for secondary text

### Step 5: Content Strategy by Service

**Bottom-of-funnel keywords to target:**

1. "custom software development dubai"
2. "inventory management system dubai"
3. "web application development dubai"
4. "AI development services"
5. "business automation dubai"

**Each page includes:**

- Service-specific hero messaging
- Relevant case studies (filtered from existing)
- Tailored pricing plans
- Industry-specific features
- Local UAE compliance mentions
- Existing testimonials (no new ones needed)
