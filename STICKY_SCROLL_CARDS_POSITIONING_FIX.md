# Sticky Scroll Cards Positioning Fix

## 🎯 Issue Addressed

The sticky scroll cards were positioning too close to the top of the viewport when they stick, making the animation feel cramped and not centered properly.

## 📋 Changes Made

### **StickyScrollCards Component** (`src/components/sticky-scroll-cards/StickyScrollCards.tsx`)

- **Before:** `sticky top-20 flex h-screen items-center justify-center`
- **After:** `sticky top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 flex h-screen items-center justify-center`

### **Technical Details**

The positioning fix uses CSS transforms to properly center the cards:

1. **`top-1/2`** - Positions the top edge of the card at 50% of the viewport height
2. **`-translate-y-1/2`** - Shifts the card up by 50% of its own height, effectively centering it
3. **Combined Effect** - The card is now perfectly centered vertically in the viewport

## 🔄 Impact on Animation

- **Improved Visual Balance** - Cards now appear centered when they stick
- **Better User Experience** - Animation feels more natural and professionally positioned
- **Consistent Viewport Usage** - Cards utilize the full viewport height more effectively

## 🌐 Pages Affected

This fix applies to all pages that use the StickyScrollCards component:

- ✅ Main custom software development page
- ✅ All template-generated pages
- ✅ Future pages using the component

## 🧪 Testing Results

- **Template Pages**: `templates/custom-software-development-dubai` - ✅ Working (200 status)

## 📱 Responsive Considerations

The fix maintains responsive behavior across all screen sizes:
