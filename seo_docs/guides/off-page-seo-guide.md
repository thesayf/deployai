# Off-Page SEO Guide: Link Building & Growth Strategy

## PHASE 1: LINK BUILDING FOUNDATION

### 1.1 Understanding Link Quality (5 Key Attributes)

#### **1. Relevance**
- **Page-level relevance:** Link from content about same topic
- **Domain-level relevance:** Link from topically related website
- **Contextual placement:** Link naturally fits within content flow

**Quality Hierarchy:**
- **Excellent:** Golf tips article linking to your golf equipment guide
- **Good:** Sports website linking to your golf content
- **Poor:** Technology blog linking to your golf site

#### **2. Authority**
- **Domain Rating (DR):** Overall website authority (0-100 scale)
- **URL Rating (UR):** Individual page authority (0-100 scale)
- **Goal:** Target sites with DR 10+ points higher than yours

**Authority Targeting Strategy:**
- **Beginners (DR 0-20):** Target DR 20-40 sites
- **Intermediate (DR 20-40):** Target DR 30-60 sites
- **Advanced (DR 40+):** Target DR 50+ sites

#### **3. Link Attributes**
- **Followed links:** No rel attribute (pass authority)
- **NoFollow links:** rel="nofollow" (limited authority)
- **UGC links:** rel="ugc" (user-generated content)
- **Sponsored links:** rel="sponsored" (paid placements)

**Priority Order:** Followed > NoFollow > UGC > Sponsored

#### **4. Anchor Text**
**Natural Distribution:**
- **Brand name:** 30-40% (YourSite, YourSite.com)
- **Generic:** 20-30% (click here, this article, read more)
- **Naked URL:** 10-20% (https://yoursite.com)
- **Keyword-rich:** 10-20% (best golf clubs, golf equipment)
- **Partial match:** 5-15% (golf tips, equipment guide)

**Red Flag:** Over-optimization with exact-match keywords

#### **5. Link Placement**
**Value Hierarchy:**
1. **Editorial within content** (highest value)
2. **Contextual in relevant sections**
3. **Author bio/resource sections**
4. **Navigation/sidebar** (lower value)
5. **Footer links** (lowest value)
