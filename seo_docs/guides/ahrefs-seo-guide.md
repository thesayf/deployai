# Complete SEO Guide: Steps to Rank on Google

## STEP 1: KEYWORD RESEARCH & VALIDATION

### 1.1 Find Initial Keyword Ideas

**Tools Needed:** Ahrefs Keywords Explorer, Google, or free alternatives

**Process:**
1. **Create seed keywords** - Start with 3-5 broad terms related to your niche
2. **Generate keyword ideas using:**
   - Phrase match reports in keyword tools
   - Google search operators: "write for us" + [your niche]
   - Competitor analysis (find their top pages)

**Example:** For a golf blog, seeds might be: "golf balls," "golf clubs," "golf hats"

### 1.2 Apply the 5-Point Keyword Validation Checklist

**For each keyword, check:**

#### ✅ **1. Search Demand**
- **Criteria:** Minimum 300+ monthly searches
- **Tool:** Check search volume in keyword research tool
- **Red Flag:** Keywords with 0-50 searches unless very specific to your business

#### ✅ **2. Traffic Potential** 
- **Process:** Look at top 3 ranking pages and their total organic traffic
- **Criteria:** Top pages should get significantly more traffic than the keyword's search volume
- **Example:** Keyword has 1,100 searches but top page gets 5,300 monthly visits
- **Tool:** SERP overview in keyword tools or free SERP checker

#### ✅ **3. Business Potential (Score 1-3)**
- **Score 3:** Direct sales opportunity (e.g., "buy used golf clubs")
- **Score 2:** Can easily recommend products (e.g., "best golf clubs")
- **Score 1:** Relevant traffic but hard to monetize (e.g., "what is golf handicap")
- **Score 0:** Ignore - no business relevance

#### ✅ **4. Search Intent Match**
- **Use the 3 C's Analysis:**
  - **Content Type:** Blog posts, videos, product pages, landing pages
  - **Content Format:** How-to's, listicles, reviews, tools
  - **Content Angle:** Freshness (current year), "for beginners," "best," etc.
- **Process:** Search your target keyword and analyze top 10 results
- **Green Light:** You can create the same type/format of content
- **Red Flag:** All results are e-commerce pages but you have a blog

#### ✅ **5. Ranking Difficulty Assessment**
Ask these questions about top 10 results:
- Do some pages fail to match search intent closely? (Good for you)
- Can you get more quality backlinks than current ranking pages?
- Is your website's authority (DR) similar to ranking sites?
- Is your site equally topically authoritative?

**Rule of Thumb:** More "yes" answers = better chances of ranking

### 1.3 Keyword Modifiers for Efficiency

**High Business Value Modifiers:**
- best, top, vs, versus, review, compare

**Informational Modifiers:**
- how, what, why, guide, tutorial, tips

**Process:** Filter keyword lists using these modifiers to quickly find relevant opportunities
