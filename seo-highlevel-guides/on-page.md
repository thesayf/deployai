# On-Page SEO Guide: Page Creation & Optimization

## PHASE 1: KEYWORD RESEARCH & VALIDATION

### 1.1 Generate Keyword Ideas

**Tools Needed:** Ahrefs Keywords Explorer, Google, or free alternatives

**Process:**
1. **Create 3-5 seed keywords** related to your niche
2. **Use phrase match reports** to expand keyword list
3. **Analyze competitor top pages** for keyword opportunities
4. **Apply keyword modifiers** for efficiency

**Keyword Modifiers by Intent:**
- **Commercial:** best, top, vs, versus, review, compare
- **Informational:** how, what, why, guide, tutorial, tips
- **Transactional:** buy, price, cost, cheap, discount

**Example Seed Research:**
- **Niche:** Golf blog
- **Seeds:** golf balls, golf clubs, golf hats
- **Modifier search:** "best golf balls" → 125,000 keyword ideas

### 1.2 Keyword Validation Checklist

**For each keyword, verify:**

#### ✅ **Search Demand**
- **Minimum:** 300+ monthly searches
- **Tool:** Check search volume in keyword research tool
- **Exception:** Very business-specific terms can be lower

#### ✅ **Traffic Potential**
- **Process:** Check organic traffic of top 3 ranking pages
- **Good sign:** Top pages get 2-5x more traffic than search volume
- **Example:** 1,100 search volume but top page gets 5,300 visits

#### ✅ **Business Potential (1-3 Scale)**
- **Score 3:** Direct sales opportunity ("buy used golf clubs")
- **Score 2:** Easy product recommendation ("best golf clubs")
- **Score 1:** Relevant but hard to monetize ("golf handicap meaning")
- **Score 0:** Skip - no business relevance

#### ✅ **Search Intent Match**
- **Question:** Can you create the same content type as top results?
- **Red flag:** All e-commerce pages when you need blog content
- **Green light:** Content format matches your capabilities

#### ✅ **Ranking Feasibility**
- **Website authority:** Your DR within 20 points of top results
- **Content gaps:** Some top pages don't perfectly match intent
- **Backlink opportunity:** Top pages have achievable link counts
