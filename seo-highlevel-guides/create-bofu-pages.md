# Bottom-of-Funnel Landing Pages: Keyword Research to Conversion

## OVERVIEW: The BOFU Landing Page Strategy

Bottom-of-funnel (BOFU) landing pages target users who are ready to buy. These pages focus on commercial and transactional keywords where searchers have high purchase intent. Unlike top-of-funnel content that educates, BOFU pages convert.

**Key Principle:** Target keywords where users explicitly signal buying intent through their search terms.

**Success Metrics:** Conversion rates of 2-10% vs 0.1-0.5% for top-of-funnel content.
