    "workflowBreakpoints": "Aquilla has many unallocated invoices (received payments not applied to invoice level) causing poor reporting; Timesheet system cannot push all data via API into Fabric requiring CSV downloads; Power BI and Aimplan are recently introduced and not yet embedded due to lack of in‑house skills; multiple manual handoffs and reconciliation between systems causing time lost and reporting gaps.",
