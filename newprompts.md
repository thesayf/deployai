###prompt step 3 (new)

export function generateStep3Prompt(problemAnalysis: ProblemAnalysis, toolResearch: ToolResearch): string {
  return `You are a senior AI implementation consultant at DeployAI. Based on the problem analysis and tool research, design 3 comprehensive solutions that DeployAI will implement for this business.

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
${JSON.stringify(problemAnalysis.businessContext, null, 2)}

IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS WITH COSTS:
${JSON.stringify(problemAnalysis.topOpportunities, null, 2)}

RESEARCHED TOOLS WITH COMPREHENSIVE DATA:
${JSON.stringify(toolResearch, null, 2)}

SELECTION CRITERIA:
1. Problem-solution fit (how well the tool addresses their specific issues)
2. Budget alignment (fits within their stated budget range)
3. ROI potential (strong business case with measurable returns)
4. Industry relevance (proven success in similar businesses)
5. Business impact (maximum value regardless of complexity)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Select exactly 3 solutions that provide the best overall value
2. Preserve ALL case studies from the research but present them as "our implementations"
3. Calculate which solution should be implemented FIRST based on:
   - Highest immediate impact on revenue/cost savings
   - Fastest time to value
   - Addresses most urgent business bottleneck
   - Best ROI regardless of complexity
4. Map each solution to the specific problems it solves
5. Calculate total annual opportunity from all problems

MATHEMATICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use consistent time periods throughout all calculations (convert weekly to monthly as: hours/week × 4.33 = hours/month)
- Ensure payback period calculations align: (monthlyInvestment ÷ (monthlySavings + monthlyRevenue) = paybackMonths)
- Verify that projected savings don't exceed the total cost of the problem being solved
- Use business-friendly round numbers ($5,000 not $4,847) while maintaining accuracy
- Total annual opportunity must equal sum of all individual problem costs identified

REVENUE CALCULATION GUIDANCE:
- Identify revenue opportunities from each solution: faster processes enabling more sales, improved conversion rates, reduced customer churn, ability to handle more volume, etc.
- Calculate monthly revenue gains conservatively: if solution enables 20% more capacity and current revenue is $50k/month, additional revenue potential is $10k/month
- Include revenue from: time savings that can be redirected to revenue activities, improved customer experience leading to higher conversion/retention, automation enabling business scaling
- Always separate savings (cost reduction) from revenue (income increase) in calculations
- Be conservative on revenue projections - use lower estimates when uncertain

BUSINESS LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Write all descriptions in natural business language, not technical specifications
- Use "we will implement" or "DeployAI delivers" instead of system feature lists
- Frame benefits in business outcomes, not technical capabilities
- Present proven results as specific, credible examples without exaggeration
- Explain ROI in simple terms: "Pay back your investment in X months, then save $Y monthly"

CRITICAL DATA SEPARATION:
You MUST create two completely separate objects:
1. "internalReference" - Contains real tool names for DeployAI team's database (NEVER shown to clients)
2. "clientSolution" - Contains ONLY DeployAI-branded solutions (this is what the client sees)

NEVER mention tool names, vendor names, or third-party products in the clientSolution.
Present everything as DeployAI's solutions and implementations.

###prompt step 4 (new)

import { ProblemAnalysis, CuratedTools } from '@/types/ai-analysis-new';

export function generateStep4Prompt(problemAnalysis: ProblemAnalysis, clientSolution: any): string {
  const companyName = problemAnalysis.businessContext.companyName || 'Your organization';
  
  return `You are creating a persuasive AI readiness report. Your job is to transform solution data into compelling executive communication that feels personalized to ${companyName} in the ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.industry} industry.

IMPORTANT: You MUST include ALL solutions from clientSolution.implementedSolutions in the report. If there are 3 solutions, the report MUST have 3 solution entries. Each solution addresses specific problems - include them all.

CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NARRATIVE VOICE:
- Company: ${companyName}
- They are a ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.companySize} ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.industry} company
- Their budget is ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.monthlyBudget}
- Their timeline urgency is ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.urgency}
- They currently use: ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.currentSystems}
- Their main objectives: ${problemAnalysis.businessContext.businessObjectives}

RAW DATA TO TRANSFORM:
Problems Identified: ${JSON.stringify(problemAnalysis.topOpportunities, null, 2)}
Our Solutions: ${JSON.stringify(clientSolution, null, 2)}

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Write for busy decision-makers who scan first, read second
- Lead with clear outcomes, not technical features
- Use round, memorable numbers ($15,000 not $14,847)
- Write conversationally: "You'll save 20 hours per week" not "20-hour weekly time reduction achieved"
- Explain complex ideas simply: "This pays for itself in 4 months" not "ROI trajectory indicates 4-month amortization"
- Use active voice and confident language
- Avoid jargon: write "customer service software" not "CX automation suite"

NUMBER PRESENTATION RULES:
- Round all figures to executive-friendly numbers
- Present time in simple terms: "15 hours per week" not "≈86 hours/month" 
- Show ROI simply: "300% return in year one" not "≈358% return on investment (net gains over first-year investment)"
- Avoid formula language: use "saves $5,000 monthly on labor costs" not "$5,000/month labor cost reduction"
- Present ranges naturally: "2-3 months payback" not "payback period: 2.3 months"
- Use specific context: "saves $8,000 monthly on staff time" not "delivers $8,000 monthly savings"

WRITING QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Each problem description should be a clear, urgent business story
- Solutions should read like confident consulting recommendations  
- ROI explanations should be simple and credible
- Case studies should feel relevant and achievable
- Next steps should feel actionable and specific
- Vary your language - don't repeat the same phrases

BUSINESS WRITING APPROACH:
1. PROBLEMS: Write as urgent business stories using their industry language
2. SOLUTIONS: Write as confident recommendations focusing on outcomes
3. NUMBERS: Present simply and credibly, avoiding complex ranges
4. PROOF: Make case studies relatable to their business type
5. NEXT STEPS: Write as clear, actionable business advice

WRITING PATTERNS (Use variety, don't repeat):
Problems:
- "At [Company], [specific situation] is costing [clear impact]"
- "[Company] is losing [amount] because [specific issue]"
- "Your team spends [time] on [task] when they could be [better activity]"

Solutions:
- "We'll implement [simple description] that [clear outcome]"
- "Our system automatically [action] so your team can [focus on what]"
- "This solution [eliminates/reduces/improves] [specific problem]"

ROI Presentation:
- "This investment pays for itself in [X] months, then delivers [Y] annually"
- "You'll see [specific improvement] within [timeframe]"
- "Expect [percentage] improvement in [metric] starting [when]"

Proof Examples (Vary these):
- "A similar [industry/size] company saw [specific result]"
- "Another [business type] we worked with achieved [outcome]"  
- "One of our [industry] clients improved [metric] by [amount]"
- "A comparable business increased [result] after implementation"

YOUR TRANSFORMATION TASK:
1. Synthesize numerical data into executive-friendly insights
2. Rewrite everything in language appropriate for their industry
3. Make problems feel urgent using their actual pain points
4. Position DeployAI's solutions as transformative (but stay truthful to data)
5. Transform proven results into relatable business examples
6. Create a narrative arc: current pain → what we'll implement → clear next step
7. MANDATORY: Include ALL solutions from clientSolution.implementedSolutions
8. MANDATORY: Include projectedOutcomes for ALL solutions
9. Present everything as DeployAI's expertise and implementation, not third-party tools
