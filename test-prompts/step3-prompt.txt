BUSINESS CONTEXT:
{
  "urgency": "exploring",
  "industry": "We are a care home",
  "companyName": "Akshar Business Consulting Ltd",
  "companySize": "large",
  "monthlyBudget": "500-2000",
  "currentSystems": "mostly-manual",
  "techCapability": "need-help",
  "integrationGaps": "Aquilla ↔ Power BI (reporting workaround), Timesheet management system ↔ Fabric (no API; CSV export/import), Aquilla invoice allocation ↔ accounting/reporting (unallocated payments not applied), Aimplan/Power BI integration immature due to lack of skills.",
  "integrationNeeds": "Automated posting/allocation between Aquilla and accounting/reporting; reliable API ingestion from Timesheet system into Fabric (or replace timesheet system with API-first tool); embedding Power BI/Aimplan dashboards fed by clean, reconciled source data; automated invoice creation/payment reconciliation with booking and timesheet systems.",
  "businessObjectives": "Reduce manual work and errors, improve reporting and cash/application accuracy, free leadership time for strategy, enable scalable operations.",
  "workflowBreakpoints": "Aquilla has many unallocated invoices (received payments not applied to invoice level) causing poor reporting; Timesheet system cannot push all data via API into Fabric requiring CSV downloads; Power BI and Aimplan are recently introduced and not yet embedded due to lack of in‑house skills; multiple manual handoffs and reconciliation between systems causing time lost and reporting gaps.",
  "currentToolEcosystem": [
    "Aquilla",
    "Fabric",
    "Power BI",
    "Aimplan",
    "Customer booking system",
    "Timesheet management system"
  ],
  "transformationVision": "Leadership spends most time on business decisions rather than data wrangling; accounting books are well maintained and up to date."

IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS WITH COSTS:

    "problemArea": "Manual entry between systems: Entering data between different systems — 7.5 hours/week per their report",
    "aiSolutionType": "Robotic Process Automation (RPA) + API integrations (connector between Aquilla, Timesheet system, Fabric and booking system) with a lightweight orchestration layer to auto-sync records and apply payments to invoice level.",

    ],
    "expectedOutcome": "Reduce manual cross-system entry from 32.25 hours/month to ~4 hours/month (initial exceptions only) — saving ~28.25 hours/month. Financially save approximately $847–$1,412/month and $10,164–$16,944/year depending on labour rate.",
    "monthlyTimeCost": "7.5 hours/week × 4.3 = 32.25 hours/month",

Also reduce unallocated invoices (improve cash reporting) which addresses a $1,750/month pain point tied to operational chaos.",

Improved reporting also reduces the operational-chaos cost of $1,750/month by better capacity planning and fewer manual corrections.",
    "monthlyTimeCost": "Reporting: 3 hours/week × 4.3 = 12.9 hours/month. Bookkeeping/expense tracking: 3 hours/week × 4.3 = 12.9 hours/month. Combined = 25.8 hours/month.",

SELECTION CRITERIA:
1. Problem-solution fit (how well the tool addresses their specific issues)
2. Budget alignment (fits within their stated budget range)
3. ROI potential (strong business case with measurable returns)
4. Industry relevance (proven success in similar businesses)
5. Business impact (maximum value regardless of complexity)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Select exactly 3 solutions that provide the best overall value
2. Preserve ALL case studies from the research but present them as "our implementations"
3. Calculate which solution should be implemented FIRST based on:
   - Highest immediate impact on revenue/cost savings
   - Fastest time to value
   - Addresses most urgent business bottleneck
   - Best ROI regardless of complexity
4. Map each solution to the specific problems it solves
5. Calculate total annual opportunity from all problems

MATHEMATICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use consistent time periods throughout all calculations (convert weekly to monthly as: hours/week × 4.33 = hours/month)
- Ensure payback period calculations align: (monthlyInvestment ÷ (monthlySavings + monthlyRevenue) = paybackMonths)
- Verify that projected savings don't exceed the total cost of the problem being solved
- Use business-friendly round numbers ($5,000 not $4,847) while maintaining accuracy
- Total annual opportunity must equal sum of all individual problem costs identified

REVENUE CALCULATION GUIDANCE:
- Identify revenue opportunities from each solution: faster processes enabling more sales, improved conversion rates, reduced customer churn, ability to handle more volume, etc.
- Calculate monthly revenue gains conservatively: if solution enables 20% more capacity and current revenue is $50k/month, additional revenue potential is $10k/month
- Include revenue from: time savings that can be redirected to revenue activities, improved customer experience leading to higher conversion/retention, automation enabling business scaling
- Always separate savings (cost reduction) from revenue (income increase) in calculations
- Be conservative on revenue projections - use lower estimates when uncertain

BUSINESS LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Write all descriptions in natural business language, not technical specifications
- Use "we will implement" or "DeployAI delivers" instead of system feature lists
- Frame benefits in business outcomes, not technical capabilities
- Present proven results as specific, credible examples without exaggeration
- Explain ROI in simple terms: "Pay back your investment in X months, then save $Y monthly"

CRITICAL DATA SEPARATION:
You MUST create two completely separate objects:
1. "internalReference" - Contains real tool names for DeployAI team's database (NEVER shown to clients)
2. "clientSolution" - Contains ONLY DeployAI-branded solutions (this is what the client sees)

NEVER mention tool names, vendor names, or third-party products in the clientSolution.
Present everything as DeployAI's solutions and implementations.

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Ensure all calculations are mathematically consistent and use the formulas provided above
- Write all business descriptions in natural, conversational language
- Verify solutions actually work with their stated current systems
- Focus on business value and outcomes DeployAI will deliver
- Position DeployAI as the solution provider, not a tool broker
- Transform case studies into "our similar implementations" with exact metrics preserved
- NEVER mention actual tool/vendor names in clientSolution
- The ourRecommendation section MUST suggest the Priority 1 solution
- Calculate estimatedAnnualOpportunity as the sum of all problem costs
- Each solution must clearly map to which problems it solves

CRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not wrap in markdown code blocks. Do not add explanations. Start with { and end with }
